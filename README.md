# Accelerating QuantumClifford.jl using GPU kernels in CUDA.jl

This is documentation on programming efficient GPU kernels put together during
my research at MIT's Quantum Photonics Group.

For general information on GPUs regarding the hardware implementation of them
and an overview of writing fast algorithms designed for GPUs check
[/info.md](info.md).

To see tools that I found helpful while developing GPU kernels, check out
[/syntax.md](syntax.md).

The details of kernels implemented and other kernel examples with speed up
details are listed out in [/kernels.md](kernels.md)

A list of helpful resources I relied on are listed in
[/resources.md](resources.md).
